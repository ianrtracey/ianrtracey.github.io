title: Software Engineers Need to Learn Stuff that Actually Matters
---
*“I am allergic to politics.”*


This is a phrase I have heard often by peers during my (brief) tenure in the software world thus far. Heck, I am guilty of saying those very words on more than one occasion.

As a software engineer, I pride myself on building products that enrich the lives of others but as the tech industry seems to move faster each and every day, I find that it becomes easier to focus on keeping up with the latest trends rather than to pay attention to the reason that software matters at all: to serve the humans behind the screens.

In the tech industry, we often subject ourselves to [disrupt-o-mania](https://m.signalvnoise.com/reconsider-41adf356857f?gi=b5462f2a5702) where, similar to rewriting an outdated legacy codebase, we design systems in the aim of disrupting the status quo, destroying old industries and obliterating the old ways of doing things. Despite some of these disruptions being good and beneficial to a huge number of people - there are times where disruption is the irresponsible way to approach a problem.

One time, when discussing the tech industry's role in people's lies, I had a non-technical friend tell me: *“I feel like tech has left some of us behind. I feel like it’s a secret club that I am not invited to.”*

Software may be eating the world but software doesn’t rule the world. In our increasingly complex political and economic climate, it’s people who call the shots and those people need engineers who can make decisions and build systems with an understanding of how what they are building will affect the world around them.

Earlier this year, a story made headlines that highlighted how software company [Palantir’s latest software suite is being used for deportations](https://theintercept.com/2017/03/02/palantir-provides-the-engine-for-donald-trumps-deportation-machine/) under the Trump Administration. Just a few months ago, news broke that Uber [built a feature into their app to deceive local government officials](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/technology/uber-greyball-program-evade-authorities.html?_r=0) who opposed use of the app and throughout the past year Facebook has been continuously [fighting fake news](http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/09/technology/facebook-fake-news/) as the Facebook platform becomes a bigger mouthpiece for diverse and polarizing political agendas.

These examples are just a small sampling of technology's convergence with difficult political and social issues. The latest Javascript framework or NoSQL database isn’t going to get us out of these problems. Engineers are up against the inertia of the most expansive and complex legacy system on earth --the human race; a vastly distributed, inconsistent, bug-ridden, unstable, interface-free, unmodularized spaghetti codebase.

A few months ago Greg Wilson at Third Bit announced his latest book, [*Stuff that Actually Matters,*](http://third-bit.com/2016/11/13/stuff-that-actually-matters.html) that aims to break down current issues on politics, law, history and economics into easily digestible essays specifically written for software engineers. I hope that, similar to the enthusiasm mustered when picking up the latest O’Reilly book on ReactJS, this book will be devoured by engineers who can take what they learn and apply it to their current projects. I feel that this is a great initiative (I have already signed up to be one of Greg’s first draft editors) and hope to see more things like it.

People deserve software that works for them and a tech industry that is intertwined with people in a deeper way than just smartphones in every pocket or Amazon echoes in every home. The world deserves software that helps build communities, provides accurate insights and empowers the minority rather than just the majority. The tech industry is no longer the underdog darling that it once was 20 years ago and it cannot afford to continue to take a detour around difficult challenges that involve human beings.

Future software will be written by engineers who understand the state of the world, how their actions affect communities and how to make ethical decisions when faced with hard social challenges. Learning more about the world around us doesnt just make us better engineers but it makes us better people prepared for the rapid change and uncertainty of the future. I, for sure, want to be a part of that future.
