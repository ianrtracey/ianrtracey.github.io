<h4>Building world-class hacker culture in the southwest</h4>
<p>I go to a lot of hackathons after starting <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hackarizona">Hack Arizona</a>, a 800+ student hackathon based at the <a href="http://www.arizona.edu/">University of Arizona</a>.</p>
<p> Hackathons are near and dear to my heart and over the years I have been humbled by the enthusiasm and inspiration that comes out of the hacker community. <a href="https://medium.com/@iantracey/what-i-learned-about-starting-things-and-people-after-3-years-of-running-hackathons-93d9071e0496#.prhj7ftgg">I have learned a ton</a> and it has truly been a privledge to serve the community for over the past 3 years as I work to help <a href="https://medium.com/@iantracey/how-we-are-trying-to-change-the-southwest-with-a-hackathon-d807bf16b431#.qxv521h6c">foster world class hacker culture in the southwest.</a></p>
<p>I must now pass the torch to the next generation of organizers at Hack Arizona who I believe will do an even better job at expanding the conversation of what technology will look like in the southwest in the next decade. It has been one hell of a ride and by far one of the most rewarding things I have ever done.</p>
