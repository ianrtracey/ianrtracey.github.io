I believe in the potential software has to shape how we work, live and play. I am obsessed with finding challenging problems and creating immense value out of the solutions.

I work at <a href="http://latitudeengineering.com/">Latitude</a> where I design cloud APIs and backend systems for drone operations, mapping and imagery platforms. Previously I have worked on moving money through the internet at <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com">Braintree</a> and an enterprise social network at <a href="http://www.cisco.com/">Cisco</a>.

Besides writing code and designing systems, I love discovering great food and coffee, running hackathons, spending (too much) time on Spotify, exploring new cities with friends and learning new tools and technology.
