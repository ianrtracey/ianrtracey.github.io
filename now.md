I am currently working a few side projects (TBA), learning Go and Rust on the side. I am fixated on <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS">learning advanced javascript concepts and best practices</a> as well as diving deeper into <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Collective-Intelligence-Building-Applications/dp/0596529325">machine learning</a>; all while improving myself as an engineer and person by <a href="https://t.co/bBqBSFUUbK">learning more about the world around me</a>.
